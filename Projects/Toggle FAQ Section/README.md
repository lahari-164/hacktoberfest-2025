# Toggle FAQ Section

- This project is a clean and simple "Frequently Asked Questions" (FAQ) page.

# What I Made

I created a single web page that shows a list of questions. When you click on a question, the answer smoothly appears below it. Clicking it again makes the answer hide.



# Languages Used

- HTML: To structure the content (the questions and answers).

- CSS: To style everything (the colors, fonts, layout, and animations).

- JavaScript: To make the questions clickable and control the open/close toggle.
